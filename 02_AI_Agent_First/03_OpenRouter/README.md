## Rate Limits

LLMs API rate limits are measured across several dimensions:

1. Requests per minute (RPM)   
2. Tokens per minute (TPM)   
3. Requests per day (RPD)

### OpenRouters Free Models Rata Limits

OpenRouter’s free models typically have a global limit of 200 requests per day (RPD) across all free models, with some also capped at 20 requests per minute (RPM), as noted in their documentation. These limits apply to models with IDs ending in :free.

### Google Gemini Rata Limits for Free Tier

https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits

Free Tier of Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite have a limit of 1,5OO requests per day (RPD), while the limit for request per minitue (RPM) is 15 for Flash and 30 for Flash lite. There is also a cap of 1,000,000 Tokens per minute (TPM) for both the models.

For development and testing 1,5OO requests per day (RPD) is good enough, therefore **for development and test we will be using the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite model**. Both these models are also compatiable with OpenAI Chat Completion API and OpenAI Agents SDK. OpenRountes rate limit of 200 requests per day (RPD) across all free models is too restrictive for development and testing. 

Google Gemini also now support OpenAI Chat Completion API, thus we can use it with OpenAI Agents SDK:

### What is OpenRouter?
OpenRouter is a platform that provides a unified way to access a wide range of large language models (LLMs) from multiple providers, including both commercial options like OpenAI and Anthropic, and open-source models like Mistral and LLaMA. It simplifies using these models by offering a single API endpoint, allowing developers to switch between models without changing their code. The platform also optimizes for cost, performance, and availability by routing requests to the best provider based on factors like price, latency, and uptime.

### User Interface and API
OpenRouter provides both a user interface and an API. The user interface includes a chatroom where users can interact with multiple LLMs at once, as well as tools for managing accounts and monitoring usage, such as viewing token usage and costs. The API is designed for developers, offering a standardized way to integrate LLM capabilities into applications.

### Support for OpenAI Chat Completion API
Research suggests OpenRouter is compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API, mirroring its structure, including endpoints and parameters. This means developers can likely switch to OpenRouter by updating the API key and base URL, making it easy to use with existing OpenAI SDK code.

### Support for Function Calling
The evidence leans toward OpenRouter supporting function calling (also known as tool calling), allowing the AI to suggest using external tools based on input. This feature is standardized across compatible models, enabling developers to integrate functions like weather APIs into their applications.

### Hosting Models: Proxy or Host?
It seems likely that OpenRouter acts as a proxy, routing API requests to models hosted by third-party providers rather than hosting the models itself. This approach allows access to over 200 models without the infrastructure costs of hosting, with OpenRouter handling translations and authentications.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Details on OpenRouter

OpenRouter, is a platform developed to streamline access to a diverse array of large language models (LLMs), offering both a user interface and an API for interaction. This section provides a detailed examination of its features, compatibility, functionality, and operational model, ensuring a thorough understanding for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

#### Platform Overview and User Interface
OpenRouter serves as a unified interface for accessing LLMs from multiple providers, including commercial entities like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, as well as open-source models such as Mistral and LLaMA. The platform's primary value lies in aggregating these models into a single access point, simplifying the process for users who would otherwise need to manage multiple API keys and endpoints.

The user interface aspect is notably user-friendly, with features such as a chatroom enabling interaction with multiple LLMs simultaneously. This chatroom, accessible at [https://openrouter.ai/chat](https://openrouter.ai/chat), supports 1.5 billion tokens and is designed for direct engagement, making it suitable for testing and casual use. Additionally, the interface extends to account management functionalities, where users can monitor usage, view token counts, and manage credits, as detailed in documentation and user guides. For instance, users can track input and output tokens and total costs on the activity page, ensuring transparency in usage ([Connecting to OpenRouter | Novelcrafter Help Center](https://docs.novelcrafter.com/en/articles/8678022-connecting-to-openrouter)).

The API, on the other hand, is tailored for developers, providing a standardized endpoint that supports integration with various SDKs, including those compatible with OpenAI. This dual offering ensures accessibility for both end-users and technical professionals, enhancing its utility across different use cases.

#### API Compatibility with OpenAI Chat Completion
OpenRouter's API is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion API, a significant feature for developers looking to transition or expand beyond OpenAI's ecosystem. This compatibility is achieved by mirroring OpenAI's API structure, including the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and parameters such as `model`, `messages`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens`. Documentation highlights that switching involves merely updating the API key and base URL to [https://openrouter.ai/api/v1](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1), as noted in guides like [OpenRouter Quickstart Guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart) and [Connecting to OpenRouter from Python](https://medium.com/%40tedisaacs/from-openai-to-opensource-in-2-lines-of-code-b4b8d2cf2541). This compatibility extends to supporting OpenAI SDKs, making it seamless for developers to leverage OpenRouter's broader model selection without significant code refactoring.

#### Support for Function Calling
Function calling, or tool calling, is a critical feature supported by OpenRouter, enabling LLMs to suggest the use of external tools based on user input. This functionality is standardized across compatible models and providers, aligning with OpenAI's tool calling interface. The process involves defining tools with a JSON schema in the API request, where the model suggests which tool to call and with what arguments, leaving execution to the developer's code. Documentation at [Tool & Function Calling | Use Tools with OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/tool-calling) details this, providing Python examples for integrating tools like weather APIs. Not all models support this feature, with compatibility varying by provider (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude often do), but OpenRouter ensures routing only to supporting providers when the `tools` parameter is used.

#### Model Hosting: Proxy or Host?
OpenRouter operates as a proxy rather than a host for the models, routing API requests to third-party providers where the actual model inference occurs. This is evident from multiple sources, including a Reddit discussion where users describe it as a "proxy" ([r/ChatGPTCoding on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1fdwegx/eli5_how_does_openrouter_work/)), and documentation emphasizing provider routing for cost and performance optimization ([Provider Routing | Intelligent Multi-Provider Request Routing](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing)). The platform handles API translations, authentications, and response formatting, ensuring consistency, while providers like Together AI, AWS, or Fireworks host the models. This proxy model allows OpenRouter to offer access to over 200 models without the infrastructure burden, with pricing reflecting upstream provider costs plus OpenRouter's operational fee.

#### Additional Features and Operational Details
OpenRouter's platform is designed for flexibility and efficiency, supporting use cases ranging from chat applications to AI research. It offers transparent pay-per-use pricing based on tokens, with some models available for free, as noted in user guides ([Connecting to OpenRouter | Novelcrafter Help Center](https://docs.novelcrafter.com/en/articles/8678022-connecting-to-openrouter)). Features include a playground for testing models, optional prompt logging (opt-in), and streaming support, enhancing developer experience. The platform's routing strategy includes fallbacks and load balancing, ensuring high availability, and it supports advanced configurations like restricting requests to providers meeting specific pricing or parameter requirements.

#### Comparative Analysis and User Experience
For users, OpenRouter's value lies in its cost-effectiveness and broad model selection, with documentation and user feedback highlighting its ease of use compared to managing multiple API keys ([OpenRouter + LangChain: Leverage OpenSource models without the Ops hassle](https://medium.com/%40gal.peretz/openrouter-langchain-leverage-opensource-models-without-the-ops-hassle-9ffbf0016da7)). The chatroom interface, while not as feature-rich as some standalone AI chat tools, provides a practical way to test models, and the API's compatibility with OpenAI ensures a low barrier to entry for developers. However, users should note that some models require credits, with free tiers quickly exhausted, necessitating top-ups for premium access.
