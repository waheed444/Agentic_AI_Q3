# Social Media Account Management Agent Architecture

Let’s design a **Social Media Account Management Agent** for a platform that helps users manage their social media presence across multiple networks (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn). This agent will monitor account activity, suggest posts or responses, and notify users for approval. It will also allow users to manually request content schedules or engagement actions, optimized by the agent before seeking approval. I’ll include additional automation features and identify where **Large Language Model (LLM) intelligence** can enhance functionality. First, I’ll outline the requirements, then detail the implementation using **event-driven architecture (EDA)**, **three-tier microservices architecture**, **stateless computing**, **scheduled computing (CronJobs)**, and **human-in-the-loop (HITL)**.

### Implementation Using the Defined Architecture

#### Architecture Overview
- **Three-Tier**: Presentation (UI for users), Business Logic (agent processing), Data (account activity and content).
- **EDA**: Events drive activity monitoring, content suggestions, and approvals.
- **Stateless Computing**: Scalable processing of tasks.
- **CronJobs**: Periodic analytics and trend checks.
- **HITL**: Users approve actions.

#### Components and Workflow

##### 1. Three-Tier Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**:
  - **User Dashboard/App**: View account activity, suggested posts/responses, analytics, and submit requests.
  - Notifications (e.g., push alerts, email) for new suggestions or moderation alerts.
- **Business Logic Layer**:
  - **Activity Monitoring Agent**: Tracks mentions, comments, and follower changes; suggests responses.
  - **Content Generator**: Suggests posts or captions based on trends and user style.
  - **Engagement Optimizer**: Suggests automated interactions (e.g., likes, follows).
  - **Request Optimizer**: Optimizes manual user requests.
  - **HITL Coordinator**: Manages approval workflows.
- **Data Layer**:
  - Stores:
    - Account activity (e.g., postId, comment, timestamp).
    - User preferences (e.g., tone, posting frequency).
    - Content suggestions and approval status.
  - Tools: Database (PostgreSQL), cache (Redis) for real-time data.

##### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Types**:
  - `ActivityUpdate`: New mention, comment, or follower change detected.
  - `ContentSuggested`: Post or response proposed.
  - `EngagementSuggested`: Automated interaction proposed (e.g., "Like this post").
  - `HumanReviewRequired`: Approval needed.
  - `HumanResponseReceived`: User approves/modifies/rejects.
  - `ActionExecuted`: Action completed (e.g., post published).
- **Event Bus**: RabbitMQ for event routing.
- **Workflow**:
  1. `ActivityUpdate` → Activity Monitoring Agent suggests response → `ContentSuggested`.
  2. `ContentSuggested` → `HumanReviewRequired` → User approves → `ActionExecuted`.
  3. `EngagementSuggested` → User approves → Interaction executed.

##### 3. Stateless Computing
- **Activity Processor**: Stateless service (Lambda) processes `ActivityUpdate`, suggests responses.
- **Content Processor**: Stateless function generates posts/captions.
- **Engagement Processor**: Stateless service suggests interactions.
- **HITL Handler**: Stateless service manages approvals.
- **Action Executor**: Stateless function posts content or performs actions via APIs (e.g., Twitter API).

##### 4. Scheduled Computing (CronJobs)
- **Trend Checker**: Hourly scan for trending topics/hashtags → `ContentSuggested`.
- **Analytics Reporter**: Daily job generates performance reports → Stored in data layer.
- **Moderation Scan**: Daily check for flagged comments → `ContentSuggested` (e.g., "Delete this").

##### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **Content Approval**: `ContentSuggested` (e.g., "Post: Great day today!") → User approves → `ActionExecuted`.
- **Engagement Actions**: `EngagementSuggested` (e.g., "Follow @user123") → User approves → Action taken.
- **Manual Requests**: User requests "Schedule 3 posts" → Request Optimizer suggests content → User approves → Posts scheduled.
